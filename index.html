                My name is Jacob Plaisted, but I am formally known as Obiwan-Jacobi. I have
                just joined the UNH coding bootcamp to persue my passion for programming &
                technology. I am a lover of FOSS & open-source technologies, as well as, the communities
                they create. I am a huge fan of <strong>GNU/Linux</strong> Operating system.  One of my favorite past times is playing
                around on my Linux box and trying to solve all the problems, and bugs that i've created. When I'm not fixing bugs and or creating them,
                I love seeing how I can optimize my machine & tailor my UX/UI to fit my personal <i>aesthetic</i>. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp; When I'm not programming or playing around on my Computer, I love riding
                white stallions along sugar sandy beaches while my hair flows majestically from a tender
                sea breeze. Also, I love playing with my dog Linus and taking him on walks in the woods.
                Linus & I are both very passionate about eating spicy ramens.
